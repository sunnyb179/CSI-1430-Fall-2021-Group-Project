/*
* Data Abstraction:
*         1 variable, studentArray[ARRAY_SIZE], is initialized as an Student 
          array with 100 indicies to hold Student objects
*         5 variables, fileName, firstName1, lastname1, classString1, and 
          homeTown1, are initialized as strings to hold user and file input
*         1 variable, inputFile, is initialized as an ifstream to open the 
          data file
*         1 variable, GPA1, is initialized as a double to hold file input
*         5 variables, h, count, zip1, age1, and GPA1, are initialized as 
          integers to iterate, count, and store data from the file
* Input:
*         The program opens the file and reads in data
*         As each classString is read, its corresponding classInt is set
* Process:
*         The array is sorted to specification
* Output:
*         The sphere array's contents are reported and any duplicate 
          students are reported as such
* Assumptions:
*         It is assumed that the user will input valid data
